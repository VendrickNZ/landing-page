            Uvogin is the eleventh member of the Genei Ryodan. Nobunaga has compared his personality to Gon's, seeing how not only do they have the same Nen type, but their behavior is similar as well, being impulsive and short tempered. Uvogin is one of the Genei Ryodan that originated from RyÅ«seigai. However, like all of the Genei Ryodan, Uvogin doesn't hesitate to kill anyone. Out of all of the Genei Ryodan, Uvogin is the strongest in terms of physical power. Although he prefers to fight alone, Uvogin works best when fighting with a partner (specifically, Nobunaga) as he fights better when he has someone else to protect, though he would never admit it.
